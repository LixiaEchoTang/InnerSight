Unstated expectations cause most relationship troubles. Fights are not about facts but about unmet needs. I learned something simple: people remember how you make them feel, not your words. The mark you leave on their heart is what counts.

Choose your friends with care. Your peers shape your thoughts. They even set the limits of what you can think. 

The most important relationship skill is genuine connection.
