There's a gap between knowing and doing. We call it the implementation gap. We're taught to prize knowledge over action. Think on it: we honor the man who reads a hundred books a year more than the one who lives one. The facts are sound, but the stage for change is set wrong.

The breakthrough is simple. Small, steady actions. The compound effect touches all things, not just money. Daily steps aren't a bonusâ€”they are the whole game. A man who meditates ten minutes each day changes more than one who retreats for a weekend once a year.

Most people try to force change with willpower alone. What if there were a better way?
