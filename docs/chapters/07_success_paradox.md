Most chase success in ways that block it. I call this the success paradox. Here are three lessons that changed my path.

First, perfectionism doesn't lead to failure. It leads to lost chances.

Second, success comes from working backwards, not following a recipe. Look at what worked for others. Learn the rules. Then make them your own.

Third, quitting can be wise. The best know when to stop. Persistence only matters when you're moving in the right direction.
