Your life is the sum of your decisions. I learned three upgrades that changed everything. First, the 72-hour rule. For any big decision, wait three days before you act. It gives space between impulse and deed where wisdom hides.

Second, think a step ahead. Most only see the immediate effects. The smart ask, "What comes next?" Instead of asking, "How do I get what I want?" ask, "What stops me from getting it?" This flip cuts through problems.

Third, inversion. Don't ask, "How do I get what I want?" Ask, "What's stopping me?" That small switch cuts through problems that clever plans miss. Instead of asking, "How do I become successful?" ask, "What makes me fail?" The answers show your true obstacles, not some theory.

03 Decision Making Deconstructed / 决策解构  
- **Decision Rules & Thought Processes / 决策规则与思维过程:**  
  - **Apply the 72-hour rule, second-order thinking, and inversion:**  
    应用72小时规则、二阶思维和逆向思维.  
  - *Example / 例如:* Instead of asking “How do I become successful?”, ask “What’s causing me to fail?” to reveal actual obstacles rather than theoretical paths.  
    不要问“我如何成功？”，而是问“是什么让我失败？”，从而揭示实际障碍而非理论路径.
