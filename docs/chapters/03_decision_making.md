Your life is the sum of your decisions. I learned three upgrades that changed everything. First, the 72-hour rule. For any big decision, wait three days before you act. It gives space between impulse and deed where wisdom hides.

Second, think a step ahead. Most only see the immediate effects. The smart ask, "What comes next?" Instead of asking, "How do I get what I want?" ask, "What stops me from getting it?" This flip cuts through problems.

Third, inversion. Don't ask, "How do I get what I want?" Ask, "What's stopping me?" That small switch cuts through problems that clever plans miss. Instead of asking, "How do I become successful?" ask, "What makes me fail?" The answers show your true obstacles, not some theory.
