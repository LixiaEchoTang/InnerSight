System design beats willpower. It’s not about motivation—it’s about math. When you see this, you stop trying to be disciplined. You build an environment where discipline isn’t needed.

Focus on systems, not goals. Systems deliver results. The goal isn’t the point. The system is. When the system works, the goals follow. But remember, systems never work alone.
